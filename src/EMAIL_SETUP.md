## Backend Implementation Note

To fully implement user SMTP email sending, you would need a backend service that:
1. Receives email data from the frontend
2. Uses the user's SMTP settings to send emails
3. Returns success/failure status

Example backend technologies:
- Node.js with Nodemailer
- Python with smtplib
- PHP with PHPMailer

The frontend is ready to work with such a backend service.ce.
